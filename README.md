# Genetic-Optimisation-Algorithm

Genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. John Holland introduced Genetic Algorithm (GA) in 1960 based on the concept of the Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution; afterwards, his student Goldberg extended GA in the 1989.
